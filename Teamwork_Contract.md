To what goals do we all commit?
 - To get an A+ in our final project and CS 3110. Do good in regular committing, 
communicating, implementing, and testing. 

 What are our "ground rules"? Don't make an exhaustive list; stick with just a few.
 - Writing codes ELEGANTLY with comments, so that everyone can easily understand
 - Making the project as interesting as possible 
 - Updating status frequently to avoid duplicate and incompatible works
 - Be friendly. Avoid blaming and try to solve the conflicts in a friendly way.

How frequently will we communicate? How quickly are responses expected?
 - Twice a week (and an extra meeting in the week when the checkpoint is due)
 - The responses are expected preferably on the same day, no later than the end of
the next day
 
Where and how frequently will we meet? When is a person considered late to a meeting?
 - We will be meeting in the living room of Townhouse B.
 - The person is considered late if he does not arrive 15 minutes after the 
 appointment time
 
What team roles will we create? What are the responsibilities of each role? Will roles shift around, and if so, how often?
 - PM: Decide the functions that we are going to include in our project, and come up with a roadmap to such functions
 - SDE - Navigator: Arrange what should be done by each file/function by providing descriptions and invariants
       - Implementer: Coding

How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What exactly will we say to a team member who appears not to be 
contributing equally? Or to a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?
 - We go to his dorm and punish him. 
 - We pick Xarath when he's playing ADC to torture him. 
 
How will we make decisions as a team? What exactly will we do when we disagree or discover conflict? What will you use as a respectful conversation starter?
 - Brainstorm individually and discuss afterward
 - When there is a conflict, we will vote on the optimal decision. 
 - We will start the conversation pleasantly. For example, go for dinner
 together and talk through.

What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?
 - Revisit the contract when unexpected conflicts and difficulties happen
 - Read through the contract together again and determine who is responsible
 - Modify the contract if necessary

How will we make this experience fun?
 - By earning everyone an A+
 - By selecting a topic that we all enjoy
 - By communicating in a positive way 
 - By adhering to our contract and remembering individual responsibilities
