1. Eight Ball Simulation: This project simulates a regular 8-ball game on a 
pool table. There are several physical principles that are crucial during each
shot: 1) after the cue hits the cue ball, how will the cue ball move 2) after 
the cue ball hits the target ball, how will both balls move 3) If there is spin and side on the cue ball, how will the cue ball moves after hitting target ball and the cushions. To simulate these physical principles, there are several potential variables in our program: radius of the balls; strength of each shot; spinning speed of the cue ball; size of the pool table; size of the pocket, etc. At the of the program, we may implement a GUI to visualize the pool table and 
how each shot takes place. 

2. Contract Bridge Game: This project aims to replicate the intricate game of contract bridge, a classic card game of strategy and teamwork. The core challenge in this endeavor is to craft an adept AI opponent for players. Here's a detailed breakdown:

Levels of AI Difficulty: Three distinct AI levels will be developed, catering to various skill levels of human players:

Rookie: Basic strategy, often choosing cards to play at random or following rudimentary tactics.
Veteran: Incorporates intermediate strategies. It anticipates players' moves based on the cards played so far and tries to maximize its chances of winning each round.
Master: This would be the zenith of our AI design, employing complex algorithms, possibly involving machine learning. The AI at this level would attempt to mimic the strategies used by professional bridge players, making it a challenging opponent even for seasoned players.

Multiplayer Mode: Beyond the AI, a multiplayer mode can be incorporated where players can either battle against other live players or team up with friends to play against the AI. This mode can further enhance the real-world feel of the game.
 
3. Project Idea: AI-Powered Flashcard Generator
Category: Educational Tool / API Integration
Overview:
In this OCaml-based project, the focus is on developing a flashcard application that harnesses the computational power of OpenAI's API. The goal is to redefine the self-study paradigm by automatically generating flashcards that pinpoint core concepts from educational material. Users can submit text in various forms, which the system then processes and converts into informative, easy-to-use flashcards.

Objectives:
Automate Flashcard Creation:
Streamline the cumbersome process of manually making flashcards, allowing users to concentrate on actual learning.

Enhanced Study Material:
Generate high-quality study aids based on analyzed text, targeting core concepts and relevant details.
